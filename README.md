I am using [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm) to handle git functions from my $HOME directory. ([This](https://yadm.io) and [this](https://gist.github.com/bentheax/a0307d464b7534593eac) give more info about yadm.)

I recently switched from bash to zsh, using [zsh4humans](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh4humans) as my starting point.
